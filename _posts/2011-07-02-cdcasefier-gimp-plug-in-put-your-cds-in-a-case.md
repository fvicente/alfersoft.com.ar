This Python-Fu plug-in for Gimp will let you put a scanned CD photo into a &#8216;virtual&#8217; case.

To use it, install the plug-in, open the CD image with Gimp and then go to Filters -> Artistic -> CD Casefier&#8230;

Select the size of the (square) output image and click OK.

Depending on the image chosen, you may want to set the &#8220;Try to crop corners&#8221; option, which works best for real CD scanned pictures.

## Installation notes:

Just untar-gzip the file into your `~/.gimp26/plug-ins` folder. Make sure that the cdcasefier.py is executable.

**Note:** The case picture used by this plugin was stolen from the [Rhythmbox](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox) project.
