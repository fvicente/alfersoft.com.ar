Today I&#8217;m introducing another utility script written in python that uses wxPython to edit your scanned images (JPEG, BMP, TIFF, etc.) obtain sub-images, rotate and save them.

<!--more-->

This first version is very basic but effective, there is no necessity of learning complex commands or image handling programs, just:

* click in the upper-left corner
* click in the lower-right corner
* rotate if you wish
* close and save

The unfortunate name of this script is **cutnrot** ðŸ˜€ and it is released under BSD license, download, modify and use it at your own risk, as usual.
